---+!! PlainFileStoreContrib

%TOC%

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

An implementation of a Foswiki store using nothing more sophisticated than files.

Advantages:
   * Uses simple files - no shell commands used
   * Incorporates script for moving between store implementations

The usual store implementations (RcsLite and !RcsWrap) use a version control tool - RCS. There are some issues with these implementations:
   * !RcsWrap invokes external programs. These are reasonably fast, but cause major performance problems when used with a web server accelerator, such as =fcgi= or =mod_perl=. Most sites therefor use:
   * !RcsLite, which is a pure-perl implementation of RCS. This doesn't use any external programs _but_ is very inefficient with topics that have large numbers of versions.

The PlainFileContrib implements topic and attachment histories by keeping a _complete file_ for each version of the topic/attachment. This means it is less efficient in terms of disk space than RCS - at least, it is less efficient for text files; binary files, such as images, are equal. For many sites this is an acceptable tradeoff, as disk space is relatively cheap, and Foswiki doesn't use much even with this store.

   * Webs map to directories, like in the RCS stores
   * Topics are stored in web/topic.txt, like in the RCS stores
   * Topic histories are in web/topic,pfv/
   * Attachments are in web/topic/attachment, like in the RCS stores
   * Attachment histories are in web/topic/attachment,pfv/
   * Histories consist of files numbered for the revision they store
The latest rev also has a history file (note: this means that
everything is stored at least twice; same as in the RCS stores)

There is currently no way to move from an RCS-based store to a !PlainFile store, so this extension has to be regarded
as experimental at this stage. If there is sufficient interest, I will develop tools to support migration to and from
RCS histories.

Developers note: this contrib is tested using the standard store unit tests.

---++ Moving between store implementations
The =tools/change_store = script included in this module allows you to move
between different store implementations. The script uses internal, unpublished
store APIs.

To support source and destination store implementations that both use files on
disc pointed at by ={DataDir}= and ={PubDir}=, the the script supports
redirecting the output of the conversion to a different directory.

Run the script without parameters to get instructions:

<verbatim>
$ tools/change_store.pl -I lib
</verbatim>
