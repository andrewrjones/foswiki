---+!! PlainFileStoreContrib

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

An implementation of a Foswiki store using nothing more sophisticated than files.

Advantages:
   * Uses simple files - no RCS operations required
   * Very simple

The default store implementations in Foswiki use a version control tool - RCS - in the background. There are some issues
with these implementations:
   * !RcsWrap invokes external programs. These are reasonably fast, but cause major performance problems when used with a web server accelerator, such as =fcgi= or =mod_perl=. Most sites therefor use:
   * !RcsLite, which is a pure-perl implementation of RCS. This doesn't use any external programs _but_ is very inefficient with topics that have large numbers of versions.

The PlainFileContrib implements topic and attachment histories by keeping a complete file for each version of the topic/attachment. This means it is less efficient in terms of disk space than RCS - at least, it is less efficient for text files; binary files, such as images, are equal. For many sites this is an acceptable tradeoff, as disk space is relatively cheap, and Foswiki doesn't use much even with this store.

   * Webs map to directories, like in the RCS stores
   * Topics are stored in web/topic.txt, like in the RCS stores
   * Topic histories are in web/topic,pfv/
   * Attachments are in web/topic/attachment, like in the RCS stores
   * Attachment histories are in web/topic/attachment,pfv/
   * Histories consist of files numbered for the revision they store
The latest rev also has a history file (note: this means that
everything is stored at least twice; same as in the RCS stores)

There is currently no way to move from an RCS-based store to a !PlainFile store, so this extension has to be regarded
as experimental at this stage. If there is sufficient interest, I will develop tools to support migration to and from
RCS histories.

Developers note: this contrib is tested using the standard store unit tests.
